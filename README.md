## HEADS

There is great potential for utilizing the data routinely produced by
modern healthcare systems in electronic health records, administrative
databases, clinical registries, and other clinical systems. Health data
scientists are therefore needed to make sense of all the data, derive
new knowledge about health, disease, and treatments, and especially
provide answers to research questions which are otherwise hard or even
impossible to address by traditional study designs.
